# BankNoteRecognition
This project seeks to develop a proof of concept prototype for an automated system to be used by the International Commercial Bank (ICB), that is able to classify two different types of Jamaican bank notes - namely the one thousand dollar (J$1000.00) and five hundred dollar (J$500.00) notes. The prototype was developed using images of the bank note collected from digital photographs or found on the internet, that were then used to train a neural network model to classify other images. This model is intended to be further trained to recognise other Jamaican bank notes in future iterations of the project.
